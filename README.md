# How to Play

You have 10 seconds to land your lunar module in the pad.
Watch out to not crash into anything and make sure to:
- Land slowly
- Land upright
- Land with all feet on the pad

- **Left/Right arrows**: Rotate your ship
- **Space/Up Arrow**: Engage thrusters

Are you good enough to land your ship during night time as well? ;)
